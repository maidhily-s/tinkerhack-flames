## Basic Details

[[FLAMES Matchmaking APP]](https://maidhily-s.github.io/flames-matchmaker-guru/)

### Project Description
FLAMES but Make It Chaotic is a fun Gen-Z themed matchmaking Progressive Web App that analyzes compatibility using zodiac signs derived from date of birth, personality traits, and uploaded selfies. The app calculates compatibility percentage and situationship risk while delivering humorous meme-style roasts based on personality and vibe analysis.

### The Problem statement
Traditional compatibility apps are either too serious or completely random. There is a lack of interactive, engaging, and relatable tools that blend fun, personality, and realism into matchmaking experiences for younger audiences.

### The Solution
Our app combines astrology logic, personality alignment, age-gap realism, and selfie-based vibe analysis to generate compatibility scores along with entertaining roast-style outputs. It transforms the classic FLAMES game into a modern interactive matchmaking experience.
